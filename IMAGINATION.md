# 🧠 IMAGINATION

Wow, that's so nice! But not as good as the SpongeBob one...

## Simple

Too simple, imagine a version of GitHub Ipsum 🚀 →

> Gitum ipsum push origin master: Commit often, perfect later. Clone to create, fork to diversify, branch to develop. Pull requests welcome, > but review with caution. Markdown is the canvas, code is the art. Open source is the heart, collaboration is the part. Issue raised,
> discussion sparked. Labels tagged, milestones marked. Stashes stack, diffs detect, merges made, conflicts checked.
>
> Contributor creed, star the deed. Wiki weaves words, actions heed. README rendered, documentation centered. Merge conflict, code inflict, > continuous integration predicted. Pull the latest, trust the greatest, strive for the best, forget the rest.
>
> Pushed to prod, deployed the mod. Semantic versioning, feature endorsing. Docker contained, Kubernetes ordained. Actions automated, > workflows created. Binary released, versioning increased. Hacktoberfest themed, open-source dreamed.
>
> In Git we trust, in users we discuss. With every commit, the project does fit. Through every line, with time it'll shine. Together we code, > in this collaborative mode. Gitum ipsum, forever and beyond.
>
> Repositories reign, while issues explain. Commits capture moments, branches provide > components. From the first init to the final commit bit, every line of code has a > spirit, every function has a wit. Git blame to trace, rebase to replace, cherry-pick > to embrace. Actions run, tests spun, till the build is done.
>
> Open an issue, ignite the tissue. A thread of thoughts, where ideas are bought. Wiki > pages turned, as knowledge is earned. Stargazers gaze, maintainers appraise, while > forking paves multiple ways. Secrets secured, licenses ensured. Gist jotted, ideas > spotted.
>
> Actions crafting, artifacts drafting. CI/CD flow, making the code glow. PR reviewed, > and comments ensued. From alpha to beta, with a data setter, till the stable release > feels neater. From the depths of dark mode, to the syntax that's showed, Git's lore is > an endless road.
>
> Hooks triggered, figures configured. Nightly builds sleep, while release branches > leap. With every pull, the repo's full, with every push, emerges a new bush. Gitum > ipsum's tale, in the world of code, will never stale.
