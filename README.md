# Markdown Link Issue

I've encountered an issue when using links within a `markdown` file, specifically inside [blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1).

Here are a few examples:

## 1. Example

This [link to imagination](IMAGINATION.md) works properly.

> However, this [link to imagination](IMAGINATION.md) does not work within a blockquote.

- This [link to imagination](IMAGINATION.md) works properly in a list.

> > Interestingly, this [link to imagination](IMAGINATION.md) also doesn't work within nested blockquotes.

### Note: This [link to imagination](IMAGINATION.md) works properly in a header
